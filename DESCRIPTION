Description: PeptidePCA contains a small suite of functions that can be used to recreate PCA figures from Hilton et al. (2017). HLA peptide sequences can be transformed into new features using an amino acid conversion matrix and then plotted using PCA. The packages ggplot2 and FactoMineR are required.
